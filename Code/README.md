# OPC: One Page CPUs

Welcome to the OPC series of CPUs, where everything fits on one page - one page each for specification, emulation, HDL. For details see the [OPC Project web pages](https://revaldinho.github.io/opc/).

The OPCs range from OPC1 for CPLD to OPC6 for FPGA, which has been run successfully on several FPGA dev boards. For the OPC5, OPC6 and OPC7 there's also a C model for the [PiTubeDirect project](https://github.com/hoglet67/PiTubeDirect/tree/opc6), which runs on a Pi as a second processor for an Acorn BBC micro.
